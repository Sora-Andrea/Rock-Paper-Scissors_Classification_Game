Initially trained the model with the default YOLO11 settings but the augmentation might have been too aggressive, cropping in particular might have affected training in a negative way, after tunning down the augmentations manually and increasing the image size, the model performed considerably better in all scenarios. It's still worth noting that the dataset used has a green screen background for all samples.

Had to create a venv in windows so that I could access the webcam directly running the app on windows instead of WSL 

TO MAKE THIS WORK IN WSL YOU MUST:
Set up a custom config file for the wsl kernel that supports device access (link to someone who got something similar to it working)

Source for the information about USB/IP tools (WSL): https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win?tab=readme-ov-file#share-devices
• Install USB/IP Tools on Windows 
You need the usbipd-win tool to manage the forwarding of USB devices: usbipd-win installer (.msi file) from the official GitHub page

• Install USB/IP Tools on WSL (POWERSHELL as ADMIN)
Next, install the client-side tools within your WSL distribution. First update your package lists
# sudo apt-get update
• Then install the usbip tools for WSL
# sudo apt-get install linux-tools-generic linux-tools-wsl
• List all available USB devices to find your webcam's bus ID:
# usbipd list
• Identify your webcam in the list (look for "webcam" or the manufacturer's name) and note its BUSID (e.g., 4-4).
• Bind the device, making it available for WSL attachment:
# usbipd bind --busid <busid>
(Replace <busid> with the actual ID from the previous step).
• Once the device is bound, you can attach it to WSL (do not close the administrator PowerShell window):
# usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid>

(You no longer need administrator privileges for this step, but run it from the same PowerShell instance for simplicity). 
5. Verify and Use in WSL
The device is now connected to your WSL instance. 
Return to your WSL terminal.
Verify the device is connected using the Linux command lsusb:
# sudo apt install usbutils
# lsusb
You should see your webcam listed. It will likely appear as a device file such as /dev/video0.
You can now use Linux applications (like guvcview or cheese) or programming libraries (like OpenCV) to access the camera within WSL. 

Important Note: While the device is attached to WSL, it cannot be used by Windows applications. To switch back, run the detach command in an administrator PowerShell prompt: 
powershell
# usbipd detach --busid <busid>

Sharing a device is persistent; it survives reboots. (bind)
Attaching devices to a client is non-persistent. You will have to re-attach after a reboot, or when the device resets or is physically unplugged/replugged.
